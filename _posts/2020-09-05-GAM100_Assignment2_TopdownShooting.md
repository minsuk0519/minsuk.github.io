## Summary

This project was the first game I've ever made. Since I had no skill on time management, I really was pressed for time and cannot solve the physics problem occured from knockback motion. Also, it took too much time for me to build the hierarchy system. The project was solo project. I thought i have no talent on artistic skills. I did not draw any of assets on my project. It makes my project poor. What i learned from the project was importance of time management and visual factor.

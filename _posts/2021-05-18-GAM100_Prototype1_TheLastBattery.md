## Brief Description

 This is the first project that I worked with other people. With two team members, we dicided to make a 2D puzzle game with [Zero Engine](https://www.zeroengine.io/). It is 2D platform puzzle game that player can spawn it's clone and able to change the position with the clone. The game is motivated from [Escape Goat][https://store.steampowered.com/app/251370/Escape_Goat/] and [Portal][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(series)] series.

## Summary
As level designer, I want to make challenging puzzle game that player must think wisely to solve the level. However, making a intuitive tutorials that makes player understand the whole game mechanism. Most of playtesters judge that the game is too hard even on tutorial level. Making the sentry bot and build simple AI was very fun. ![image-left]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/GAM150_SentryBot.gif){: .align-left}

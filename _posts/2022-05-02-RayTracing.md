## Project Description

Solo 3D Rendering engine with Vulkan API from my cs562 class(advanced real time rendering technique).

## Date

January, 2021 - April, 2021

## Purpose

## Feature
- Hybrid rendering(deferred + forward) with multiple lights [Report](https://github.com/minsuk0519/cs562/blob/main/report/CS562_Project1_m.kim.pdf)
- Moment shadow map for better performance [Report](https://github.com/minsuk0519/cs562/blob/main/report/CS562_Project2_m.kim.pdf)
- Physics based rendering with Image-based lighting [Report](https://github.com/minsuk0519/cs562/blob/main/report/CS562_Project3_m.kim.pdf)
- Alchemy ambient occlusion [Report](https://github.com/minsuk0519/cs562/blob/main/report/CS562_Project4_m.kim.pdf)
- Global Illumination with precomputed light probes [Report](https://github.com/minsuk0519/cs562/blob/main/report/CS562_Project5_m.kim.pdf)
